## Master Thesis 

This directory contains the text (and defense presentation) for my Master's Thesis based on Eval-UA-tion, which contain more details than the paper.

The **defense presentation** is done in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (new favourite thing ever), and the slides with a green square in the bottom-left contain additional [quarto-roughnotation](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-roughnotation) animations viewable after pressing `R` (in the correct zoom). **Viewable at <https://serhii.net/F/MA/presentation>**
