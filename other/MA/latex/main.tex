\begin{abstract}

This Thesis describes the creation of Eval-UA-tion, a suite of Ukrainian-language datasets developed to assess Large Language Model (LLM) performance in Ukrainian. 
The collection encompasses three groups of tasks: UA-CBT (inspired by the Children’s Book Test, a fill-in-the-blanks task aimed at assessing comprehension of story narratives) built on LLM-generated stories, UP-Titles (which involves matching articles from the online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda with their correct titles from ten similar choices), and LMentry-static-UA (LMES), modeled after the LMentry benchmark, featuring tasks simple for humans yet challenging for LLMs, such as comparing word lengths or finding the first/Nth/last letter/word in words/sentences. With the exception of  UP-Titles, all tasks are designed to minimize potential contamination by utilizing material unlikely to be found in LLMs training data. For all datasets, a separate few-shot prompting split is included to further reduce contamination risks. Human and random baselines are provided for all tasks. 
The Eval-UA-tion benchmark was evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-4, and three Mistral-7B–based models, two of which were fine-tuned on the Ukrainian language. The results demonstrate than Ukrainian-language fine-tuning can improve performance on Ukrainian-language tasks, and that with adequate fine-tuning smaller open-weights models can compete and, in some cases, outperform much larger commercial LLMs such as GPT-3 and GPT-4.

% I'd like to thank the many people without whose support I could have never finished (or even started) this Thesis. 

% Mariia, marrying whom was the best decision I've made in my entire life, whose love and support throughout the years improved my life in ways I never thought possible.

% % The acknowledgments and the people to thank go here, don't forget to include your project advisor\ldots
% My family. My father, who was the first to make me notice and love language and languages, and from whom I learned the imperative \textit{\enquote{Безобразно но единообразно}} — \textit{it may be ugly, but it has to be consistent} — that guides the way I approach writing any kind of documents to this day.
% My mother, whose strong opinion that \enquote{\textit{Scientific work is the most interesting things one can do}} stuck with me and ultimately motivated many choices, including ones that resulted in the writing of this Thesis.
% My grandmother, who counted out loud the steps on the stairs to our second-floor apartment from the first weeks of my life, and who was an example of how to be calm, purposeful and determined in the face of any adversities life can throw at you.
% I realize how lucky I am to have a family that surrounded me with love, valued education, and gave me an environment where I could follow \textit{my} interests.

% Christian Hänig, my scientific advisor, colleague and friend, always extremely interesting to talk to, knowledgeable in many areas not limited to Machine Learning, and an inspiration in many things, including on how to approach life in general.
% I'm thankful he agreed to supervise a Thesis heavily involving the intricacies of a language he does not speak, and for his suggestions, ideas, and answers throughout the process.

% Anna-Izabella, who wrote the Telegram bots that made human evaluation of these datasets a less soul-crushing task than it could have been, despite my initial skepticism of the idea.

% And all the people who dedicated their time and energy to the filtration and correction of stories and training instances, as well as to the creation of human baselines:

% The memories we made laughing over the infinite iterations of stories about turtles who wanted to become tailors are forever.

% Anhalt University of Applied Sciences, for providing the resources and compute capacities without which this Thesis would not have neither an \textit{Evaluation} section, nor half of the UA-CBT stories.

I am immensely grateful to my wife, Mariia, whose love and support have improved my life in ways I never thought were possible. 
She was also the first beta-tester of Label Studio layouts and the first human annotator, back when nothing worked yet and when annotation was a much more lonely process. 
Marrying her remains the best decision I have ever made. 

I owe a deep debt of gratitude to my family. My father was the first to ignite my passion for language and languages, and from whom I first heard the single crucial imperative of document preparation originally formulated by a former coworker of his — \textit{\enquote{Безобразно но единообразно} — ugly as it may be, it has to be consistent}. My mother, whose words \textit{\enquote{Scientific work is the most interesting thing one can do}} stuck with me and ultimately resulted in the writing of this Thesis. 
My grandmother, 
who counted out loud for me the steps on the stairs to our second-floor apartment from the first weeks of my life and who was waiting for me to start University since I was five years old — and who will forever stay an example of the virtues of calmness, purposefulness, and determination. 
% Their collective love and emphasis on education created a nurturing environment that allowed me to pursue my interests.
I realize how lucky I am to have a family that surrounded me with love, valued education, and provided an environment where I could follow my interests.

I want to give special thanks to Christian Hänig, my advisor and friend, whose scientific expertise and approach to life in general have been greatly inspiring. I appreciate his willingness to oversee a thesis on a language unfamiliar to him and for his invaluable guidance throughout this project.

I'm thankful to Anna-Izabella Levbarg, whose initiative in creating the Telegram bots made human evaluation from a daunting task into a manageable one; her help with generating the unmasked version of the UP-Titles dataset has been invaluable as well.

I extend my gratitude to all who invested their time and effort to the annotation (filtration and correction of stories and test instances) and the creation of the human baselines:
Daria Kravets, Lina Mykhailenko,  Viacheslav Kravchenko, Oleksii K., @arturius453 and R. 
Our shared laughter and trauma over infinite iterations of stories about turtles dreaming of becoming tailors are forever.
And the extra sets of eyes, who asked questions and noticed inconsistencies made a big difference on the quality of the final datasets.

Lastly, I am grateful to Anhalt University of Applied Sciences for providing the necessary resources, including server access and financial support, that were crucial for the experiments and the generation of the UA-CBT stories.

% I owe a deep debt of gratitude to my family. My father ignited my passion for language and languages, imparting the crucial lesson of consistency in document preparation—Безобразно но единообразно (it may be ugly, but it has to be consistent). My mother instilled in me the belief that scientific work is among the most intriguing pursuits, influencing many of my life's decisions, including the undertaking of this thesis.
