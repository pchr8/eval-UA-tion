# Eval-UA-tion 1.0 

## Intro
This repository contains the scripts used to generate and evaluate the datasets from the Eval-UA-tion 1.0 benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Ukrainian.

It was initially my Master's Thesis (see [/other/MA](/other/MA)) and was accepted to [UNLP 2024 \| The Third Ukrainian Natural Language Processing Workshop](https://unlp.org.ua/) (preprint here: [Eval-UA-tion 1.0: Benchmark for Evaluating Ukrainian (Large) Language Models - Archive ouverte HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04534651)).

## TL; DR
- Benchmark for evaluating LLMs in the Ukrainian language
- 3 novel tasks (9 datasets in total).
- All with human baselines, most contamination-safe (for now...) 
- See presentation (<https://serhii.net/F/MA/presentation/#/3/1> / </other/MA/presentation>) for more.
- **TODO** UNLP video and presentation will be added here when completed.

## This repository 
- [/code](/code) contains the (messy) code used to generate and evaluate most of the tasks
- [/other/MA](/other/MA) contains my Master's Thesis and defense presentation (that have more details than the paper)
